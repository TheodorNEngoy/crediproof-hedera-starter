# CrediProof — 60–90s pitch

Problem: PDFs and screenshots aren’t trustworthy; SMEs can’t easily finance invoices.

Solution: Hash-anchor invoice JSON to **HCS**; mint **HTS** fungible tokens representing the face value; transfer to buyer; settle & **burn**. Everything is verifiable in **HashScan**.

Demo script: Run the CLI, copy IDs, paste into HashScan, show message, token supply, transfers, burn, and balances.
